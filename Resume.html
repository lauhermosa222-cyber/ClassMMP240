<h2>Objective </h2>
<p>
    I’m a creative and proactive professional with a strong interest in digital marketing, social media management, and content creation. I enjoy working independently and in team environments, sharing ideas, and finding practical solutions. 
I’m particularly drawn to roles that involve managing social media, creating visual content, and using graphic design to engage new audiences. 
I’m bilingual (English and Spanish), adapt easily to new tools and platforms.
I am currently seeking marketing, content, or customer service opportunities, preferably online or remote, but open to in-person roles.
